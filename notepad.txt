classification of the api calls into stuff
the api endpoints i have
8) randomPanelQuestion: sel explanatory
9) question stats: this gives the stats of a questions, like number of likes, and acs and other stuff
10)this gets the code: (this is an authenticated request): this gives the code and other information, from the submission id
11) community solution: this gets one community solition dor a topic id
12) questionNote: (authorized)( this gets the note for a particular question if you wrote it)
13) problem questionList: this is similar, to the panelQuestionList
14) languageList: this gets all the language, alson with their id(imp)
15) submission details, this is similar to the thing, this gets code
16) userQuestionstatus: (a) tells if a questions is completed or not(and other shit)
17) user session progress(authenticated) gives the pichart thing, with other information
18) singleQuestionTopciTags: gives the tags of a question
19) recentAcSubmissions(a) gets the recent acs, of a person, based on what the users can see


so presently are the base, endpoints, based on these, ill be adding more features, for some processing to these endpoints, 


in the submission list, check if you can make the limit, and offset default


note: do this as soon as possible
check how to decrease your schema, and how to decrease the number of code you write


check if i can make a base model for the common imports, make the code more readable
